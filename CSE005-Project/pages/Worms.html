      software that has the nature to replicate and spread within a network at a
      fast pace. The worm consumes the bandwidth as it spreads. This in turn

        various devices. According to Cisco the way that worms infect computers
        includes spam email or instant message attachments which are also a
        delivery method. According to this source the messages utilize social
