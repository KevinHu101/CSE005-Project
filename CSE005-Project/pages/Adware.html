    <div class="subtitle">Introduction</div>
    <div class="text">
      Adware is a kind of software that shows unsolicited commercials on a
      user's device. Some adware is innocent and only helps developers make
      money, but others can be invasive, monitor user behavior, or even be
      dangerous for security.
