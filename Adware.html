    <div class="title">Adware</div>
    <div class="byline">By Raina</div>

    <div class="subtitle">Introduction</div>
    <div class="text">
      Adware is a kind of software that shows unsolicited commercials on a
      user's device. Some adware is innocent and only helps developers make
      money, but others can be invasive, monitor user behavior, or even be
      dangerous for security.
    </div>

    <div class="subtitle">How Adware works</div>
    <ul>
      <li class="text">
        Installed by rogue websites, bundled software, or misleading downloads
        <br />
        Inserts advertisements into system notifications, apps, or webpages
        <br />
        "Advertising-supported software," or "adware," is a category of software
        that shows advertisements on computers and mobile devices, gathers user
        information for marketing, and occasionally reroutes search results to
        websites with advertisements. Although the majority of adware is
        harmless and makes money from display and pay-per-click advertisements,
        some can be harmful and work similarly to malware by monitoring user
        behavior and selling information to outside parties. Adware first
        surfaced in 1995 and was once thought to be spyware, but as time went
        on, its legitimacy increased. But from 2005 to 2008, there was more
        surveillance because of worries about dubious adware tactics. Unclosable
        windows and pop-ups are two ways malicious adware can infiltrate devices
        and jeopardize privacy. In order to safeguard against malicious adware,
        users should install antivirus software such as Bitdefender, Avast, or
        Kaspersky and refrain from clicking on suspicious ads or links

      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="subtitle">Types of Adware</div>
    <ul>
      <li class="text">
        <img src="../assets/AdwareAssets/Adware-2-WhiteServer.png" />
        Apps that are legitimately sponsored by advertisements (such as free
        apps with advertising)
        <br />
        Adware that is malicious (such as tracking, diverting, or installing
        other undesired apps)
        <br />
        Adware, which stands for advertising-supported software, is a category
        of software that frequently inserts itself into operating systems or web
        browsers to show users unsolicited ads. While some adware is harmless
        and uses ad placements to support free software, others are invasive,
        slowing down computers, changing browser settings, and monitoring user
        behavior for commercial gain. Through keyboard logging or user
        redirection to fake websites, malicious adware might potentially
        jeopardize personal information. Usually, bundled software downloads,
        misleading pop-ups, or weaknesses in security that let it install
        undetected are how adware spreads. Pop-up advertisements, slow device
        performance, site changes, and unknown battery depletion on mobile
        devices are all common indicators of infection. Users should install
        trustworthy antivirus software, keep their computers updated, stay away
        from suspicious websites, and exercise caution when giving apps rights
        in order to prevent adware infections. If adware is found, it can be
        removed by deleting questionable apps, doing anti-malware checks, and
        clearing the browser's settings to get rid of any remaining evidence of
        undesired software.

    <div class="subtitle">Risks and Dangers</div>
    <ul>
      <li class="text">
        Reduces the speed of the gadget<br />
        Monitors user information and browsing patterns<br />
        May result in more malware infestations
        <img src="../assets/AdwareAssets/Adware-3-WhiteAds.webp" />
        Adware is software that installs adverts on a device without the user's
        permission; it frequently does this through malicious websites or free
        apps. Adware can range from being merely bothersome to tracking user
        data or causing malware and scams. It typically spreads through
        compromised websites that take advantage of browser flaws or by being
        included with freeware or shareware. Adware can slow down devices,
        change browser settings, display excessive pop-ups, adverts, and
        redirects, and track surfing data to sell to marketers once it has been
        installed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="subtitle">Prevention and Removal</div>
    <ul>
      <li class="text">
        <img src="../assets/AdwareAssets/Adware-4-WhitePrevent.png" />
        Don't download unidentified applications.
        <br />
        Utilize ad-blockers and antivirus software.
        <br />
        Manually delete adware from system settings and browsers.
        <br />
        Legitimate adsupported software, potentially unwanted programs (PUPs)
        that come with downloads, browser hijackers that alter settings without
        authorization, and device-specific adware that differs depending on the
        operating system are all examples of adware. Even though adware is
        sometimes prohibited, laws differ. In the United States, spyware is
        illegal in more than 20 states, and if a large-scale adware infection
        results in damages of more than $5,000, it is illegal under federal law.
        Users should use antivirus software, keep their computers updated, stay
        away from dubious advertisements, and only download apps from reliable
        sources in order to prevent adware. Adware can be manually eliminated by
        device and browser settings or by employing security software.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="subtitle">Conclusion</div>
    <div class="text">
      Adware can be a small inconvenience at times, but it can also seriously
      jeopardize device performance and privacy. To keep your browsing
      experience safe, you must understand how it spreads and how to stop it.
