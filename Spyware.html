    <div class="text">
      Define what spyware is as a type of malicious software that is designed
      how to gather the information from different devices without the user of
      the devices knowledge. Then I would briefly explain the actual purpose of
      spyware, such as data theft, unauthorized access to peoples information,
      and surveillance. Finally the impact spyware has on individuals an big
      organizations, that are related to privacy concerns and money loss.

    <div class="subtitle">Types of Spyware</div>
    <ul>
      <li class="text">
        Keyloggers: The record keystrokes is to capture the sensitive
        information such as password and card information.
        <br />
        <br />
        Adware: Can track users activity that deliver it to the targeted
        advertisements.
        <br />
        <br />
        Trojans: To disguise legitimate software to collect data secretly.
        <br />
        The article is basically detailing the study on spyware, it discussed
        the definition, the types of spyware, explained what propagation methods
        were and what its functions were in spyware, and the impact that it has
        had on computer softwares. The definition of spyware and its types is
        that spyware is a software that has collected users data without their
        consent. Its Types have included adware, browser hijackers, keyloggers,
        and spybots. Spyware is usually used for personal spying, personal
        surveillance, and for gathering mass data collection that have financial
        gain. The propagation methods of spyware spread when there is security
        vulnerability, weak software, and misleading downloads. The article
        spoke on a case study that has examined the seismic entertainment that
        is a company that has exploited the security flaws in an installed
        spyware, then later would sell “anti - spyware” solutions. The solutions
        that the article proposed are multiple anti- spyware tools such as being
        cautious of downloads, and having software up to date, as spyware is
        becoming a growing problem that requires users' awareness.

        The article explores spyware as a growing threat to computer security
        and privacy. Spyware refers to software that is installed
        surreptitiously on a computer to monitor user activities that send data
        to the third parties, it includes adware, keyloggers and trojans. The
        businesses use spyware legally as its marketing or software updates,
        that it is often misused for hacking, identity theft, and unauthorized
        surveillance. The spyware spreads through the software, drive - by
        downloads, emails attachments, and security vulnerabilities. It can slow
        down computers, alter browser settings, display intrusive ads, and
        compromise personal data. The efforts to lower the chances to regulate
        spyware that include legislation such as the spyblock act, but
        enforcement that challenge the corporate interests and evolving threats.
        The users that should be avoid suspicious downloads, that would use anti
        - spyware software, read the agreements carefully, and the vigilant
        against the system activity. The spyware is expected to become more hard
        to understand, making awareness and proactive security measures that are
        essential.

        To practices to best avoid the spyware that infectics a device, such as
        being cautious to download the regular software updates.
        <br />
        It is also recommended to download anti-spyware tools and the

        The impact of spyware on users and society these are the key points.
        Spyware that can range to the relatively harmless adware that is
        dangerous keyloggers that would steal personal data.That is often
        bundled the freeware and shareware, that leading users to install it
        without them knowing. The users either would accept spyware that would
        trade-off for free software or would be unaware of its risks. Spyware
        that can be harmful to computer viruses, that leading security breaches,
        corporate data leaks, identity theft. The Theory of Planned Behavior
        (TPB), the factors like awareness, it perceived control, and social
        influence that affects if users take action against spyware. There needs
        to be solutions first in education with users being more educated and
        awareness is critical in protecting themselves.
