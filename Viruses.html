    <div class="text">
      A virus is a type of malware that attaches itself to a host file or
      program and spreads when executed. It spread from device to device. Also,
      it goes after your personal and financial information and steals it all.

      <li class="text">
        A computer virus is a virus that spreads through everything like your
        personal and not personal information that you have and you can’t stop
        it as soon as it spreads it keeps on going. Also, it can spread within
        all of your device.

        Recovering from viruses is by making sure your personal information is
        secure and don’t use unknown websites that can leak your information as
        well. And making sure you don’t give out any personal information to
        unknown sources too.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li class="text">
        The biggest threat that viruses have is that it can spread through all
        of your devices and do the same thing in all of them. Like hacking in
        all your personal’s informations and financial information as well.

    <div class="subtitle">Conclusion</div>
    <div class="text">
      Computer viruses are the most common and dangerous types of malware,
      capable of disrupting personal, corporate, and even national security
      systems. They spread through everything like emails and malicious
      websites. Also causing data loss, financial damage, and system failures.
      If you don’t stop the virus early enough it can be too late and all your
      information will be gone and stolen and you can’t do anything about it.
