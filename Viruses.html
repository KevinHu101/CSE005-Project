      A virus is a type of malware that attaches itself to a host file or
      program and spreads when executed. It spread from device to device. Also,
      it goes after your personal and financial information and steals it all.

        A computer virus is a virus that spreads through everything like your
        personal and not personal information that you have and you can’t stop
        it as soon as it spreads it keeps on going. Also, it can spread within
        all of your device.
        <br />
        This article compares viruses in humans with viruses in computers. This
        is because the way viruses spread in humans is similar to the way they
        spread in computers. In humans, it spreads from person to person by
        contact, while in computers, it spreads from computer to computer by
        infected attachments and plugging into infected hardware. The viruses
        continue to spread until eventually people stop opening infected
        attachments in computers or with close contact in humans. Overall, I
        agree with this because it's true that viruses can be in humans as well
        as in animals and computers. The way viruses start and spread in humans
        and computers aren’t that differen

        Recovering from viruses is by making sure your personal information is
        secure and don’t use unknown websites that can leak your information as
        well. And making sure you don’t give out any personal information to
        unknown sources too.

        In this article, it explained the dynamics of computer virus propagation
        using mathematical models based on SEIRQ. It was revealed that the
        importance of studying computer virus propagation was all due to the
        spread of networked systems, mobile technology, and the internet.
        Overall, this research talks about the major impact of network structure
        on computer virus propagation and how mathematical models are deemed
        important when trying to predict future viruses tha

        The biggest threat that viruses have is that it can spread through all
        of your devices and do the same thing in all of them. Like hacking in
        all your personal’s informations and financial information as well.

        In this article, it talks about a research study that primarily focuses
        on the development of numerical schemes, which illustrates how computer
        viruses and malware are distributed worldwide. This study uses the
        Micken’s methodology to construct a different analogy that describes
        different ways that viruses and malware are distributed in computer
        networks. Overall, this research study conveys the different possible
        ways and methods on how they think these viruses and malware are
        spreading throughout the virtual world

    <div class="subtitle">Conclusion</div>
    <div class="text">
      Computer viruses are the most common and dangerous types of malware,
      capable of disrupting personal, corporate, and even national security
      systems. They spread through everything like emails and malicious
      websites. Also causing data loss, financial damage, and system failures.
      If you don’t stop the virus early enough it can be too late and all your
      information will be gone and stolen and you can’t do anything about it.
