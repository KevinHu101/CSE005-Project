      According to Cisco, a worm is defined as a type of malware or malicious
      software that has the nature to replicate and spread within a network at a
      fast pace. The worm consumes the bandwidth as it spreads. This in turn
      overloads infected systems making them unreliable. A big threat that Worms
      pose is that it can alter or eliminate files and introduce other malware.

        A computer worm works through infestation, infection, and parasitism
        within the network. They spread through the internet, emails, file
        sharing platforms, instant messaging, etc. Furthermore the impact of
        computer worms has caused billions of dollars in damages within frequent
        decades. Different types of computer worms include morris worm,
        wannacry, Love Bug, etc.

        Worms pose is that it can alter or eliminate files and introduce other
        malware. It is important to know that a worm is not a virus contrary to
        popular belief but comparable to a virus it can cause data loss. Having
        a worm is definitely more serious than a virus in the sense that it
        “self-replicates” and spreads automatically throughout various devices.
        According to Cisco the way that worms infect computers includes spam
        email or instant message attachments which are also a delivery method.
        According to this source the messages utilize social engineering which
        enables users to think the “unsafe” fuels are safe to open. Other
        methods include USB drives. Overall this article demonstrates methods of
        how to ensure cyber safety from the infections known as worms.

        Recovering from Worms we understand the impact of worms especially
        considering that it's crucial to know how exactly to bounce back from
        such an infection. It is crucial to deal with the presence of malware
        such as this. Using and maintaining anti virus software aids in

        Within this article the question of whether an antivirus software can
        fight off a computer worm is explored. The three points that the article
        outlines is the process of how a computer worm works through
        infestation, infection, and parasitism within the network. They spread
        through the internet, emails, file sharing platforms, instant messaging,
        etc. Furthermore the impact of computer worms has caused billions of

        worms include morris worm, wannacry, Love Bug, etc. Going on into
        further information the site describes how to tell if your device has a
        worm, how to remove a worm, etc. Knowing that prevention aids to protect

        Recovering from Viruses, Worms, and Trojan Horses, we understand the
        impact of worms especially considering that it's crucial to know how
        exactly to bounce back from such an infection. It is crucial to deal
        with the presence of malware such as this. Using and maintaining anti

        website is to inform users on safe online practices through tips and
        advice to follow. Knowing that there is no one specific way to tell
        whether a computer has been infected doesn't necessarily help but it's
        important to prevent rather than to lament.
